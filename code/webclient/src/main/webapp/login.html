						participating SHRINE Organizations are: Beth Israel Deaconess
						Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital
						Boston, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General
						Hospital. Each Participating SHRINE Organization individually
						contributes and allows access to aggregate clinical data for
						research purposes only. Your signature certifies that you
						understand and agree to all applicable terms contained herein.</p>

								expertise;<br />
							</li>
							<li>I am the only individual who will be authorized to
								conduct actual queries.<br />
							</li>
							<li>I assume full responsibility for adherence by my
								collaborator with the SHRINE BusinessRules and will obtain and
								retain a signed copy of this Terms-of-Access Agreement to

							</li>
							<li>I agree to restrict all queries to the query topic
								approved by the Data Steward.<br />

								reviewed and approved or rejected by a Data Steward and that
								subsequent individual query requests will be audited for
								adherence to the initial approval.<br />

							property deriving from SHRINE data acquisition and analysis is
							governed by a separate agreement requiring that I initiate the
							resolution process by reporting potential &quot;discoveries&quot;
							to my institution's technology transfer or intellectual property
							office.<br />
						</li>
						<li>I agree to adhere to my home institution's policy
							regarding retention and destruction of data.<br />
						</li>
						<li>This Terms-of-Data-Access Agreement will end upon
							termination of my appointment at Harvard Medical School or
							termination of my employment by a Participating SHRINE
							Organization.<br />
						</li>
						<li>I understand that any violation of this agreement will
							subject me to disciplinary action by my institution in
							consultation with the appropriate office at Harvard Medical
							School/Harvard University.</li>
